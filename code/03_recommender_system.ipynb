    "This recommendation aims to build a generalized system that shows the top movies/shows per genre. The idea behind it is that people will tend to like more popular shows/movies with high ratings. The setup includes engineering a new feature that will multiply the popularity scores with the IMDB ratings. This feature will lower the rating for films/shows with low popularity and IMDB ratings. While magnifying films/shows with high popularity and ratings. It is a straightforward model since it is primarily just sorting the data to the arguments provided. At the same time, only return titles within the 95th percentile."

However, passed that point, we start to observe some discrepancies in the output. For instance, beginning from Crashbox, and below are children shows. Its content is wholesome compared to South Park, which contains stronger languages with more explicit and mature content. A limitation of this recommender is that it doesn't consider MPAA/TV ratings. As seen from the result, the discrepancies arise are from the difference in the content's intended audiences.\n",

Feature used to train the model are plot summary, genre, IMDB rating, TMDB ratings, popularity score, year released, and type of content (show or tv). After adding the vectorized plot and genre to the numerical and binarized features, I ended up with over 60,000 columns. Therefore, a PCA is employed to reduce dimensionality. This step's logic is that the predicted probabilities from the model will have an added weight when calculating for similarity score due to the effects from the features use to train the model; in return, it will better fine-tune the recommendations. \n",

However, the improvement observed still came with some errors; some children still show being recommended, such as Yogi Bear.

I encoded them into numerical values (conversion is based on personal judgment) and combined them with the IMDB ratings. The recommender then follows the same procedure from the two systems mentioned above (appending values to vectorize matrix and calculating score). The idea behind this approach is that it will magnify the effect of MPAA/TV ratings in generating similarity scores. "
